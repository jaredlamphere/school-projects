# school-projects
Hello this is a Repo of the diffrent school work projects i have had over my student career.
The files cover my first ever python projects when i started coding and various other projects like creating a dice roller for fun.
It also contains the start of my journey into AWS and the SDKs and creating diffrent functions to do launch or do various tasks in the cloud.
I'am always open to feedback and tips so feel free to leave comments on what and how to improve the code.
